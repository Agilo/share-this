            What we like more from the previous snippet is that we start always
            with a lot of enthusiasm, our initial code state is in a
            <strong>clean and beautiful state</strong>, all seem to be perfect
            like in a <strong>piece of art</strong>

        </p>
        <p>But later, you all know, new features are coming, the <strong>project
            gets bigger and complex</strong> and the code starts becoming a pure
            mess. Is that what we start calling it <strong>code that
            sucks!</strong> Nobody wants to work on that crappy and messy code
            and moreover everyone want to start over all from scratch.
